    description:
      "My goal was to create a robust and dynamic web application that facilitates information sharing and community interaction. by integrating a full-stack development approach. The Q&A discussion platform is a web application designed to allow users to ask questions, provide answers, and engage in discussions. The purpose of this platform is to create a community where knowledge can be shared and accessed easily. Users can sign up, post questions, respond to existing questions, upvote or downvote responses, and mark the best answer. The application aims to foster a collaborative environment where users can learn from each other.",

    subtitle: "Budget Manager",
    description:
      "I chose to build a budget manager using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) to address a common need for effective financial management. It is a practical tool designed to help users manage their finances by tracking their income and expenses. Users can input their financial transactions, categorize them, and view detailed reports and summaries of their financial activities. This project provided an opportunity to enhance my full-stack development skills while developing a practical application that enables users to track their spending, establish financial goals, and make well-informed financial decisions.",

    subtitle: "Weather Application",
    description:
      "Developing a weather application with React and Redux significantly improved my proficiency in contemporary web development and state management. This project yielded a practical and valuable tool that assists numerous individuals in organizing their weekly schedules according to weather forecasts. The application dynamically furnishes weather data for a span of 5 days, catering to any location specified by the user. Key functionalities include an intuitive interface facilitating city searches and weather information retrieval, real-time data retrieval from a public API, and a responsive design optimized for seamless usage across desktop and mobile platforms.",

    title: "React, Redux and Framer Motion",
    subtitle: "ToDo Application",
    description:
      "I decided to create a to-do list app using React for the UI components, Redux for managing state, and Framer Motion for animations because I wanted to practice integrating these technologies together. The purpose of the project was to create a simple yet visually appealing to-do list where users could add, edit, and delete tasks with smooth animations provided by Framer Motion. One of the main challenges I faced was integrating Redux with Framer Motion for handling animations based on state changes. It required careful management of state updates and animation triggers to ensure smooth transitions between different states of the to-do list.",
