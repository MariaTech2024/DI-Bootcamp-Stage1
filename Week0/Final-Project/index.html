              Winston's father didn't think that he was smart enough to study
              politics or law so he enrolled him in the army classes instead.

  <!--Quote about the person-->
  <cite>"I now put Churchill, with all his idiosyncrasies, his indulgences, his
    occasional childishness, but also his genius, his tenacity and his
    persistent ability, right or wrong, successful or unsuccessful, to be
    larger than life, as the greatest human being ever to occupy 10 Downing
    Street." - Roy Jenkins concludes his biography of Churchill</cite>
