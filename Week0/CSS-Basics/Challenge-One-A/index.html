          <div id="poem">
            <ul>
                <ol>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</ol>
                <ol>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</ol>
                <ol>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</ol>
                <ol>And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</ol>
                <ol>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</ol>
                <ol>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</ol>
                <ol>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</ol>
                <ol>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:</ol>
                <ol>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</ol>
                <ol>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</ol>
                <ol>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</ol>
                <ol>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</ol>
                <ol>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</ol>
                <ol>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</ol>
